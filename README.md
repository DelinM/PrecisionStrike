## Quick Introduction

**PrecisionStrike** is the **free** and the **advanced** alternative! 

PreceisionStrike acts like a mouse jiggler, except that it is more than a mouse jiggler sold on the market. It allows you to set a timer for the duration of mouse movement activity and actions (such as computer sleep/shut off, etc.) after preset time is up.



## Background (TL;DR)
It was personal, and I will get personal. 

3 years ago in 2019, I was assigned to update over 5,000 digital forms for a inventory collection exercise. The task involved clicking 6 buttons (using some logic) and writing a sentence for each form. At the time, I did not have any idea on how to change data in backend. The only method I had was to actually click and write sentence in each form. I could only do 500 in a day, 10 days to complete this boring task. It sounded pathetic.

A friend (C# God) introduced me to AutoHotKey, and I quickly deployed an AutoHotKey script to do the work for me. This was the start of me doing programming for work. After 3 days, I developed some python scripts to do more complex things, and writing small scripts became a part of my daily work.  After 3 years, I am pursing a masterâ€™s degree in computer engineering.

I don't really use AutoHotKey anymore, it sucks. AutoHotKey was not meant for GUI design, there are plenty of good tools out there, but I feel that I must develop something so that it can benefit other people. 

AND OF COURSE, without a strong AutoHotKey community I would not be able to complete PrecisionStrike. This is ME giving back to the open source community (:.

PS, PrecisionStrike has a bug, but you will only notice it when you pay attention. Life is short, I have so many things to master and pursue. **I will no longer be updating PrecisionStrike.**

PSS, PrecisionStrike is also Pump Calc.exe. WHY? WHAT WITH THE NAME? It is an inside joke that is only shared with insiders ;).


## How to Use
Go to the **executable** folder, and download **PumpCalc.exe**. The interface is very self-explanatory.

NOTE: PRESS **ESC** to end the program!
